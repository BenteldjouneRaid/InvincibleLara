    <h1>Invincible Lara</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>In a small, quiet village, there lived an elderly woman with striking beauty. Her real name was Lurankisha, but everyone knew her as Lara. She spent her days tending to a garden that once flourished with memories. Every flower in that garden was a silent testament to a love she never dared to claim. That love belonged to her childhood friend—the boy who played beside her under the shade of trees, who shared her laughter and endless adventures. He was ambitious, optimistic, radiant like the dawn of a new day.</p>
        <p>Actually he was the one who named her Lara, and whenever anyone asked why, he’d  spontaneously answer "It’s invincible. She’s too strong for sadness to catch."</p>
        <p>This young man shared her pure sense of humor, ran with her through fields, tumbling clumsily, yet always there when she needed him. He was mischievous, constantly getting into trouble, but never in a way that hurt her. He would pick fights just to tell her about them later, and she cherished every moment by his side. He was always smiling, and for Lara, he was the embodiment of safety and warmth.</p>
        <p>One day, without any significance to him, he handed her a small handful of seedlings. It was a simple gesture, fleeting and unimportant to him, but to her, it was the most precious gift. She planted them, nurtured them, just as she had nurtured her love for him in silence. But happiness is never meant to last. Eventually, life carved its cruel path, tearing people apart, leaving behind a story that never really started. The boy left the village with his family, vanishing as if he had never existed—leaving behind no trace except the one buried deep in Lara’s heart and in the roots of her garden</p>
        <p>She never spoke of him.Not to him. Not to anyone. Not even to herself. Her love became a prison of silence, a letter never sent, rotting inside her like an unhealed wound. As the years passed, she imagined different endings—alternative lives where she had found the courage to confess. But time was ruthless. It stripped her bare, gnawed at her soul, and left her choking on regret.</p>
        <p>One evening, she sat on her porch, holding a worn-out photograph of their childhood in her trembling hands. Tears traced her cheeks, carving rivers of grief as she finally gathered the courage to bring her feelings to the light. She whispered her long-buried tale to the wilting petals. And with each drop, a piece of her burden seemed to dissolve. She begged her flowers to carry her sorrow, to scream out what she never could, but they remained mute, crumbling beneath her fingers.</p>
        <p>The next morning, she stepped outside to find her garden empty. Every bloom had withered beneath the merciless grasp of winter, leaving behind only a heavy silence that weighed on her like a grave unmarked. In that moment, she understood a cruel truth: love, when left unspoken, does not fade—it festers. It claws. It whispers through the years like a ghost lurking in every shadow, a wound that never heals. It had shaped her life as surely as the flowers once shaped her garden, but now, it's a wasteland, mirroring the ruin inside her.</p>
        <p>In her final moment of despair, she clutched the last remaining flower and, with a voice trembling under the weight of a lifetime of regret, she asked herself, “If time were to turn back, would I dare to tell him? Would I have the courage to break this silence? Would I dare? Or would I remain shackled in longing?” Tears fell, unstoppable—a flood of agony drowning her. But once they left her cheeks, they were gone—stolen, like everything else, by the brutality of wind and time.</p>
        <p>As soon as the rain stopped, her eyes were exhausted, hollowed out—unable to shed another tear, not even able to produce one. Then, suddenly, a solemn glow flickered from the lone rose in her hand that had been watered and soaked in the holy waters of her sorrow. A strange light expanded, swallowing the remnants of agony from within her fragile frame. And for a fleeting moment, she felt herself surrendering to something greater, a force that transcended her pain.</p>
        <p>Her body trembled, frail under the weight of decades, and she collapsed to her knees—all her senses were gone. By the time Lara opened her eyes, she felt a strange, hazy relief—a peace that seemed like a lie, a cruel trick. She stood, her tiny body trembling, and in that pivotal moment, she realized she was young again. Words could not capture the storm of emotions surging within her. Everything was a blur—joy entangled with dread, as though she stood on the threshold of both paradise and despair. Her mind was a void, her memories erased, but her heart still carried a hollow ache she could not name.</p>
        <p>It seemed that our young, lovely Lara had forgotten. Forgotten what she went through, her endless suffering, but it’s natural, I suppose. All dreams fade into oblivion once you awaken. Or perhaps that wasn’t a dream—most likely a nightmare, rather. Or could it be the powerful, unbearable desire to see someone once again had miraculously found its way into reality? Probably it was the ultimate grief—the burying of feelings that never saw the light—had been so powerful, so overwhelming, that it reached the very edge of time itself. So powerful that it looped back, bending her soul to a youth she hadn’t asked for.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, the questions burned like embers in the dark: Would Lara be capable of escaping the brutal future? Would she be able to change her fate and attain the ending she once craved, or would she choke on silence once again? Would her dreams finally break into reality, or would they rot once more in her chest? And the greatest question—by the time Lara remembers what she had seen, or it may be what she had lived through... Would she find happiness? Would destiny finally smile at her rather than smirk? Or would she still be stuck in the endless loop of tragedy, sipping it all over again—a scar deeper than the first? A timeless wound that no time could heal. A love she’d carry to her grave—spoken or not.</p>
        <p>Perhaps our young, beautiful lady would forever remain imprisoned in longing, staring into the abyss of regret…</p>
